Place everything in this folder into .config/polybar. make sure you make everything in the "scripts" folder executable. There are a ton of other modules in the config file. The config file used is new.ini, although config.ini is also pretty cool. new.sh is the script used to start all the bars, and it needs to be made executable as well. there are 4 bars, one at the top and bottom for each of my two monitors. You will need to go into new.ini and edit the monitors to fit with your setup. Other than that, if you have all dependencies installed, it should be good to go. Be sure to be aware that you will have to run wpg at least once in order for these bars to init, because the colors for each of the bars come from .Xresources, and your .Xresources need to be empty in order for wpg to work. Once you run wpg the first time, it should be good to go, and from then on if you've done everything correctly every time you log in to i3, wpg should restore your last wallpaper and colorscheme, and then apply that colorscheme, and then polybar should start automatically. Just be sure to follow all the directions and edit any paths necessary, along with the monitors.
